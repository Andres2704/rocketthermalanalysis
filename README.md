This is a repository for thermal analysis code developed by Tau Rocket Team for the Latin American Space Challenge Cooperation 2020.

### How to use RTA(Rocket Thermal Analysis):
* You can download the executable file [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHwhARq-330akTIG7l6z-7JiFtZTnFGc/view?usp=sharing).
Once you have opened RTA the main window will be something like this:

The main window is destinated to analyse the 1D temperature distribution along the motor case and for that you have two options of numerical methods. One is the implicit (recommended) and the other is the explicit method, the second one is more time consuming than the first. 

On the second tab you will be able to simulate a 2D temperature distribution along the motor's bulkhead. This is a slow method since it is explicit and bidimensional, so be patient.

All of three analysis can be exported as output txt file which you can easily import to excel or other sheet editor and also you can generate plots of the results.
