This is a repository for thermal analysis code developed by Tau Rocket Team for the Latin American Space Challenge 2021

### How to use RTA(Rocket Thermal Analysis):
* You can download the executable file [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHwhARq-330akTIG7l6z-7JiFtZTnFGc/view?usp=sharing)
Once you open RTA the main windows will be something like this:

The main windows is destinated to analyse the 1D temperature distribution along the motor cases and you have two options of numerical method for that. One is implicit (Recommended) and the another is explicit method, the second one is much time consuming than the first one. 

On the second tab you will be able to simulate a 2D temperute distribution along the bulkhead's motor. This is a slow method since is explicit and bidimensional, so be patient.

All of three analysis can be exported as output txt file which you can easly import to excel or other sheet editor and also you can generate a graphical resourses. 

All the mathematical model and validation of the software you can find here
